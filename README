A brief explanation of the algorithm used in stepcounter_next() in
src/stepcounter.c:

The acceleration in the y, i.e. vertical, direction has very the most well
formed waves for walk, run, and hop. It goes up very quickly, reaches the peak
in less than 0.1 seconds, then drop back to below zero.

For convenience, denote acceleration in the y direction as ay. Denote ax as the
acceleration in the x direction and gz as the angular speed about the z axis.

It was observed that:
  a) The difference between the ay values from adjacent records is at least
     5.0 (m/s^2) if and only if the person starts a walking/running/hopping
     cycle. This can be used to determine the start of a walk/run/hop cycle.
  b) After ay reaches a peak value (possibly multiple local positive maximi
  	near the peak), it drops below zero rather smoothly. That is, ay does
  	not oscilate above and below zero at all when it drops. This can be used
  	to determine the 'semi-end' of a cycle.
  c) The width of a wave is usually less than 0.2 seconds, which roughly
     corresponds to 200 records. Starting from the first sharp increase in
     ay, within 200 records after it, ax and gz finished their own waves as
     well. The maximal values (positive maximal and negative maximal are
     different for this purpose) of ax, ay, and az suffice to decide whether
     this cycle is a walk, run, or hop.
  d) The periods, i.e., the time intervals between adjacent peaks, are
     different for walk, run, and hop too. This can be used to further
     confirm the decision made with the observation described in (c).

     NOTE: (d) is not implemented yet. Maybe in the future if needed better
     precision.

For easy reference and future reference, here is the matrix mentioned in (c)
and (d):
         |  ax   |   ay   | 4.5*gz |     T
  -------+-------+--------+--------+----------
    hop  | 30-40 |  20-40 | 20-40  |  >   1s
    run  |  ~ 20 |  25-30 | 10-17  |  < 0.7s
    walk |  < 5  |   5-10 |  < 3   |  >   1s

Figures that illustrates the points:

  ./discover.png:
    shows the ax(red), ay(blue), and gz(green) of hopping, running, and walking
    period from ./data/Andrew_walk_hop_walk_run_stripped.csv.

    This figure is obtained by:
        ./scripts/display_csv.py

  ./my_run_walk.png, ./my_walk_hop_walk_run.png, and ./my_walk_run.png:
    Red, blue, and green spikes indicate the detection of hop, run, and walk
    step, respectively for the corresponding input csv file.
    Red, blue, and green dots are ax, ay, and gz, respectively.

    These figures are obtained by:
        cd src
        make test
	(NOTE: You have to close the current plot window to see the next plot
	window pop up just yet.)
